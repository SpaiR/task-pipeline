## [3.2.1] — 2026-07-23

Patch release. Non-breaking — no artifact-shape changes.

### Fixed
- **`roadmap-to-workflow` wave concurrency** — the script template passed `{ isolation: "worktree" }` to `parallel()`, which the Workflow tool silently ignores, so every wave actually ran all agents concurrently in one shared tree, and true per-item worktrees have no reconciliation step anyway. Waves now plan all items in parallel (each plan agent writes only its own task file, never the tree) then implement them strictly one at a time, the sole mutator of the shared tree — a plan FAIL stops before any implement, an implement FAIL stops as before. Each implement now sees its wave-mates' already-landed commits and `/verify` runs against the integrated state.

### Docs
- **VitePress documentation site** — added a searchable guide/reference site under `website/`, deployed to GitHub Pages: getting-started and core-concepts pages, per-skill workflow guides (grill, single task, roadmaps, autopilot, specs), a comparison against similar tools (superpowers, OpenSpec, spec-kit, Task Master, Matt Pocock's skills), and a full command reference. `docs/usage.md` and `docs/troubleshooting.md` are now thin pointers to the site, which is the single owner of user-facing usage prose.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-20

Replaces the confirm-before-write gate with write-then-digest. Non-breaking — no artifact-shape changes.

### Changed
- **Write-then-digest replaces confirm-before-write** — convention (b)'s print-draft → Accept/Edit/Decline gate was the pipeline's most error-prone step (three prior patch releases only papered over it) and re-reviewed content the chat discussion had already settled. Every capture skill now writes its artifact immediately, runs `validate.sh` on the written file, then prints a structural digest (path, title, sections, captured decisions/pins, validate result) inviting edits against the file. `grill` drops its ledger confirmation and prints the ledger as the digest after the pre-mortem. Chips survive only where the question isn't distilled content: config Step 0 setup and the slug-collision overwrite guard. Synced across [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md), and `self-invariants-auditor`.

### Fixed
- **`to-roadmap` / `to-spec` no longer hard-stop on unrelated artifact errors** — Step 0 treated any non-zero `validate.sh` exit as "config malformed → stop", but exit 1 means one or more *existing* artifacts failed validation; `validate.sh` never inspects `config.md` content. A pre-existing broken, unrelated file could block a fresh capture. Both now hard-stop only on a missing `config.md` (exit 2), matching `to-task` and `roadmap-to-workflow`; exit-1 artifact errors surface but don't block.

## [3.1.2] — 2026-07-19

Bugfix release. Non-breaking — no artifact-shape or layout changes.

### Fixed
- **Confirmation gate hardened further** — v3.1.1's "print the draft as message text first" wording did not change model behavior: a post-release transcript showed the turn going straight from bash checks to `AskUserQuestion` with no text block, so the draft was never actually printed. Every confirmation site (`grill`, `to-task`, `to-plan`, `to-roadmap`, `to-spec`) now carries an explicit gate — never emit `AskUserQuestion` until the full draft sits printed above it in the same reply; prior chat discussion does not count. Mirrored in both docs of record ([`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md)).

## [3.1.1] — 2026-07-19

Bugfix release. Non-breaking — no artifact-shape or layout changes.

### Fixed
- **Confirmation prints the draft first** — the model was routing all confirmation output through the `AskUserQuestion` call and skipping the draft, so users confirmed content they never saw. Convention (b) is hardened at both docs of record ([`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md)) and at every capture-skill confirmation site (`grill`, `to-task`, `to-plan`, `to-roadmap`, `to-spec`) to mandate printing the full draft as visible message text first, then posing the question in the same reply; the question box and option `preview` never render the draft.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-19

Adds a pre-capture interrogation skill and tightens the capture flow. Non-breaking — no artifact-shape or layout changes.

### Added
- **`grill` skill** — a pre-capture interrogation that sits at the "discuss freely" stage: it stress-tests a plan or decision one question at a time, keeps a running decision-plus-rationale ledger, ends with a pre-mortem, and routes to the right capture skill (`to-task` / `to-plan` / `to-roadmap` / `to-spec`). It writes no artifacts and touches nothing under `.task/`, so it can run before any capture exists and needs no `config.md`. Brings the pipeline to 6 skills.

### Changed
- **Skills and docs compacted** — skill prompts and docs were trimmed to cut runtime token cost without changing behavior. `validate` is now a bash-only utility (`skills/validate/validate.sh`); its `SKILL.md` is removed.
- **`roadmap.sh` slimmed** — dropped the `resolve_roadmap_path` wrapper and a dead guard.

### Fixed
- **`roadmap-to-workflow` auto-mark** — checkbox ticking is pinned to an anchored `awk` match and its fallback path is corrected, so the driver marks the right roadmap item.
- **Capture flow hardened** — `to-task` / `to-plan` / `to-roadmap` / `to-spec` handle empty and edge-case inputs cleanly; decline and stop branches now end with the canonical `→ Next:` footer and aligned resume cues.
- **`validate` diagnostics** — a task-subcommand miss now reports the paths it searched.

### Docs
- **Contract** — documents the 5-state roadmap checkbox class in [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md).

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-18

Chat-first rewrite. The pipeline is no longer an orchestration engine with phases, locks, and a hook gate — it is a small set of capture skills. Discuss freely in chat, then fix the discussion into a fixed-format Markdown artifact under `.task/` with one short skill; capture depth is the skill name, never a flag. There is no execution skill — every artifact carries a stamped `## Execution` block that an ordinary session follows to implement, verify, review, and commit. This replaces the entire v1/v2 surface and is breaking with no automatic migration. See **Migration**.

### Added
- **Capture skills** — `to-task` (captures `## Description`), `to-plan` (adds `## Plan`: Goal / Touches / Logic steps), `to-roadmap` (a multi-task initiative), and `to-spec` (a standalone load-bearing technical decision under `.task/spec/<slug>.md`, referenced by tasks/roadmaps via a `Spec:` header). Depth of capture is the skill, not a flag.
- **`roadmap-to-workflow` launcher** — authors and invokes a dynamic Workflow over a roadmap's unchecked items in dependency-ordered waves, opus-plans / sonnet-implements per item by default. The driver ticks each roadmap checkbox after its agent returns OK (never inside the per-item agent).
- **Stamped `## Execution` block** — every artifact carries an English, parser-stable Execution block that a plain session told `implement .task/task/<slug>.md` follows: implement the plan, run `/verify` + `/code-review`, apply review fixes within **Touches**, commit per `config.md` → Commit Format, and tick the roadmap item when `Roadmap:` / `Source item:` are present.
- **Single artifact contract** — [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md) documents the full artifact shapes, producer/consumer table, and bash-layer contract in one place.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Flat `.task/` layout** — `.task/config/config.md`, `.task/task/<slug>.md`, `.task/roadmap/<slug>.md`, `.task/spec/<slug>.md`. No `<task-id>/` subfolders, no `workspace/`, no `log/`, no archive — git history is the record. The **slug** (kebab-case, derived from the title) is the identity; task-ids and `[TASK-ID]` brackets are gone.
- **Bash layer shrunk** — `resolve-ws.sh` is now a pure `.task/`-root finder (no workspace resolution, no pointer read/write/self-heal). Only `validate.sh` and `roadmap.sh` remain alongside it.
- **Orchestration delegated to the platform** — verification, review, and per-item fan-out use `/verify`, `/code-review`, and dynamic Workflows instead of hand-rolled skill logic.

### Removed (breaking)
- **Skills** — `bootstrap`, `design`, `build`, `ship`, `roadmap`, and `auto-roadmap` are removed, along with all phase companion files and the nine audit/runner subagents.
- **Bash machinery** — the lock protocol (`auto-locks.sh`), phase detection (`phase-detect.sh`), fail-log (`fail-log.sh`), touches-gate (`touches-gate.sh`), `derive-task-id.sh`, `preamble.sh`, and the auto-roadmap helpers are all gone.
- **Layout markers** — the active-task pointer, `TASK_ID_OVERRIDE`, per-worktree pointer files, and the roadmap `.spec.md` sidecar are removed. Pipeline markers are exactly `git config task.root` plus the `.task` exclude entry.
- **`docs/spec/*`** — replaced by the single `docs/contract.md`.

### Migration
- No automatic migration from a v1/v2 `.task/` workspace — this is a clean cut. Start fresh: discuss in chat, then run `to-task` / `to-plan` / `to-roadmap` / `to-spec`.
- Replace `/task:design` + `/task:build` + `/task:ship` with: capture via `to-task` / `to-plan`, then tell a session `implement .task/task/<slug>.md` and let it follow the stamped `## Execution` block.
- Replace `/task:auto-roadmap` with `roadmap-to-workflow` over a `.task/roadmap/<slug>.md`.
- Replace `/task:bootstrap` — the four capture skills auto-run setup inline in a fresh project.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-13

Interactive-first release. The pipeline now carries a task through each phase with structured questions, so a single bare command replaces most flag fiddling; the advanced flags stay fully functional but move off the everyday surface into a documented "Escape hatches" registry. This release also removes several redundant flags/modes and reworks the multi-worktree `.task/` model — both are breaking. See **Migration**.

### Added
- **Interactive structured-choice layer** — discrete path forks are now asked as `AskUserQuestion` chips in interactive runs: design's fresh-start entry fork and `--from` item picker, build's implement→audit advance, `/task:auto-roadmap`'s roadmap picker and item-scope question (all remaining / only next / pick range). Interactive-only — the autopilot runners still pass explicit flags.
- **Design phase-advance loop** — after each design phase the skill re-detects state and asks once before chaining (Description-ready → build the plan; plan-ready → invoke `/task:build`), so one `/task:design` invocation walks the whole design half instead of needing repeated calls.
- **Bootstrap language + testing-policy detection** — `/task:bootstrap` now detects the repo's language policy and testing-policy mode and presents both as a single accept/decline/edit proposal instead of asking cold.
- **Roadmap decision harvest** — `/task:roadmap` can harvest decisions already settled in the prior conversation into a confirmed Decision Inventory before drafting, converging with the cold-start path on one pre-draft decision list.
- **Roadmap light self-check** — after authoring, `/task:roadmap` runs a report-only three-lens self-check (Coverage / Decomposition / Clarity) over the saved file and offers `--refine` inline only when findings warrant escalation.

### Changed
- **Question-driven cycle; advanced flags hidden** — `--idea` / `--from` / `--auto` / `--next` / `--refine` / `--phase` are removed from README signatures, skill `description` frontmatter, examples, and every user-facing next-step footer. The surviving flags remain functional and are documented once in `docs/troubleshooting.md` § "Escape hatches", each paired with its interactive equivalent; `/task:auto-roadmap`'s own flags stay a documented power surface.
- **Clean build proposes ship; ship commit composed from artifacts** — a clean interactive build flows into ship's single accept/decline/edit confirmation, and the commit header+body are composed from `summary.md` (fallback `task.md`) rather than free-text authoring. The audit tail is quieted to a one-line `### Result` summary (full detail stays in `audit.md`; blocking findings are always shown in full).
- **Bootstrap auto-runs on first design/roadmap** — the first `/task:design` or `/task:roadmap` in an unconfigured project auto-runs `/task:bootstrap` inline, then continues the original request (stops only if you decline).
- **Roadmap `Size` computed, `Class` inferred** — `Size` is derived from the `### Outcomes` count and `**Class:**` is a best-effort inferred, user-overridable hint; a codified archive path replaces ad-hoc naming.
- **Stale active-task pointer self-heals** — a provably-stale pointer (empty / missing workspace subfolder) is cleared with a one-line notice instead of hard-stopping.
- **Canonical next-step footer + one interaction grammar** — every core command ends with a `→ Next:` footer (or `→ Done.`), and content confirmations use one accept/decline/edit grammar.
- **Faster `/task:auto-roadmap` per item** — per-item token load and interactive validate round-trips trimmed; per-item time cut via the model split and lighter audit.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Multi-worktree `.task/` model reworked** — the `.task` symlink and `/task:bootstrap` join-mode are removed. All worktrees of a repo now share one `.task/` resolved via `git config --local task.root` (written by bootstrap; `dirname(git-common-dir)` fallback), and the per-worktree active-task pointer moved from the worktree-root `.task-current` into git's per-worktree dir (`git rev-parse --git-path task-current`). Bootstrapped repos migrate automatically on the next command.

### Removed (breaking)
- **`/task:ship --full` and the hand-supplied commit slug** — `/task:ship` has one mode (full close); the slug is always auto-derived. Both removed forms now fail loud.
- **`/task:ship --next` subtask-transition mode** — removed. This also fixed a bug where `--next` wiped a subtask's Description without archiving `task.md`; every close now archives `task.md`.
- **`/task:build --auto`** — removed; the interactive implement→audit advance question replaces it (the audit ≤2-iteration bound is unaffected).
- **`/task:design --idea` and the design idea phase** — removed; brainstorm a task in chat, then run `/task:design "<description>"`.
- **`--full chore-finalize` recovery convention** — collapsed to a bare `/task:ship`.
- **`validate.sh todo` legacy intake name** — removed; use `validate.sh roadmap <path|slug>`.

### Migration
- Run bare `/task:ship` (default full close, slug auto-derived) instead of `/task:ship --full` or `/task:ship <slug>`.
- Clean up an aborted `/task:auto-roadmap` run with a bare `/task:ship` instead of `/task:ship --full chore-finalize`.
- Replace `/task:build --auto` with a normal `/task:build` and accept the implement→audit advance question when prompted.
- Replace `/task:design --idea` by discussing the task in chat first, then `/task:design "<description>"`; work a multi-item roadmap by re-running `/task:design --from <roadmap>` per item.
- Reach design's plan-refine via `/task:design --phase refine` (repair-level, documented in `docs/troubleshooting.md`).
- Use `validate.sh roadmap <path|slug>` in place of `validate.sh todo`.
- Multi-worktree setups: standalone per-worktree `.task/` is no longer supported — all worktrees share one `.task/` via `git config task.root`, migrated automatically on the next command. To point the pipeline at an existing `.task/` yourself: `git config --local task.root /abs/path/containing/dot-task`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Bootstrap onboarding primer** — after writing `config.md`, `/task:bootstrap` now prints a fixed-template primer that teaches the mental model at first value: the four `.task/` artifacts and what each holds, phase auto-detect on re-run, the umbrella/subtask model, and the exact next command. Static template (localizable per `config.md` → Language).

### Changed
- **`/task:auto-roadmap` collapses the per-item cycle into one item-runner subagent** — now that nested subagents are supported, each item's design → implement → audit → ship runs inside a single disposable `auto-roadmap-item-runner`, returning only a compact report-card digest to the driver. Driver context stays flat, lifting the previous ~15/~25-item auto-compact ceiling on long runs. The per-stage model split, fail-stop, sentinel, and cross-worktree contracts are preserved; `is_last` is now computed via checkbox look-ahead, fixing a latent dangling-umbrella case when a trailing item was already done.
- **Skill descriptions rewritten as trigger→result** — the six user-invocable skill descriptions drop the internal `[N·phase]` prefix codes (which collided across skills) in favor of a when-to-use then what-it-does form, so the `/` menu reads as guidance rather than pipeline taxonomy.
- **Design open names the plan-building next step** — the quick-draft next-step hint now names the action and the artifact (review `task.md`, then run `/task:design` again to build `plan.md`) instead of the opaque "auto-enters blueprint", removing the most common stall before a first ship.
- **README and troubleshooting reworked for new users** — a copy-paste quickstart leads the README (the dense flag list is demoted to a "Command reference"), a new safety section states upfront what the pipeline touches in your code and git, and the troubleshooting page is rewritten around first-run symptoms keyed on the literal strings the tool prints.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Tool-agnostic references** — the authoring guidance and heuristic lists no longer privilege specific products or language stacks. The pipeline already resolved all tooling from `config.md` at runtime; now bootstrap's config-authoring guidance and the README use role-based phrasing, the roadmap per-task verification reminder and the commit fallback template defer to `config.md`, and `touches-gate` path extensions plus `audit-context` lockfile excludes broaden to a language-agnostic superset (a missing entry only skips a fast-path, never yields a wrong result).

### Fixed
- **Pipeline root discovery** — `.task` is now located by a git-style upward walk (`find_ai_dir` in `_lib/resolve-ws.sh`) instead of being assumed at the current working directory. Skill bash helpers (`validate.sh`, `phase-detect.sh`, the context scripts, `close.sh`, `auto-roadmap-context.sh`) previously failed with `config.md not found` whenever the shell had drifted out of the project root; they now resolve `.task` from any subdirectory. Linked-worktree `.task` symlinks are preserved (so the local `.task-current` is still found), and a call from outside any project still fails cleanly with the same message.
- **Roadmap sidecar enumeration** — `/task:auto-roadmap` and `/task:roadmap --refine` no longer list `<slug>.spec.md` / `<slug>.refine.md` sidecars as spurious "[malformed]" or empty roadmaps when enumerating `.task/roadmap/`. Both enumerators now skip the sidecars, matching what `validate.sh` already carved out.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-23

First public release. A linear task pipeline for Claude Code — design → build → ship — with explicit, file-backed checkpoints and an off-cycle roadmap track.

### Added
- **Pipeline skills** — `/task:bootstrap` (one-time per-project config), `/task:design`, `/task:build`, `/task:ship`, plus the off-cycle `/task:roadmap` and the `/task:auto-roadmap` autopilot. Phase-decomposed orchestrators (`design` → open / idea / blueprint / refine; `build` → implement / audit) dispatch to companion phase files.
- **Artifact contract** — every stage reads and writes plain Markdown under `.task/` (`task.md`, `plan.md`, `audit.md`, `summary.md`), reviewable without the agent and enforced by a PreToolUse validator hook.
- **Read-only audit lenses** — six auditor-class subagents (Reuse / Simplicity / Clarity for the build audit phase; Coverage / Decomposition / Clarity for `/task:roadmap --refine`) fan out in parallel; build audit runs a bounded, scope-gated auto-fix loop.
- **Roadmap autopilot** — `/task:auto-roadmap` drives a whole roadmap item by item in the interactive session, with a per-item model split (cheaper model for the implement stage via `plan.md → Implement-Model:`).
